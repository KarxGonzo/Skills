# 5. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 9 if the number is less than 10, prints 19 if the number is less than 20, prints 29 if the number is less than 30, and prints -1 otherwise (only one print statement should occur).

puts "Pick a number."
input = gets.chomp
number = input.to_i 

if number < 10
  puts 9
elsif number < 20
  puts 19
elsif number < 30
  puts 29
else 
  puts -1
